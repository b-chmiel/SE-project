## Service

Service enables interactions between UI and database providing multiple (22) methods processing database content to useful form.

### Service architecture

As part of RESTful system the logic of service is deployed as single unit meeting criteria of all-in-one monolithic application. Logic, data computing are carried with controllers while data structures are defined as models. Data access is implemented with entity framework using Npgsql as ADO.NET data provider.

### Service functionality

Service allows:

- creating user accounts,
- to authenticate with UUID,
- managing cars, insurances,
- storing car diagnostic data and
- administering visits.

Currently used endpoints along with their documentation can be found [here](https://se-project-2020.herokuapp.com/swagger); prepared with OpenAPI â€“ available [here](https://se-project-2020.herokuapp.com/swagger-implemented.json) and in [project files (*wwwroot/swagger-implemented.json*)](wwwroot\swagger-implemented.json).
